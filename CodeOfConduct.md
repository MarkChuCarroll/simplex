Simplex Code of Conduct
===========================

(This CoC is based on the CoC of opensource.com, which I thought was excellent.)

The Simplex project is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for
everyone, regardless of race/ethnicity or national origin, sex or gender, gender
identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
mental illness or neurotypicality, body size, caste, age, or religion. We acknowledge
that cross-cultural communication can often be complicated and encourage everyone to
consider the impact of their words and actions on those with different backgrounds
and experiences. We do not tolerate harassment of members of our community in any form.

The Simplex project community is open, kind, and inquisitive.

Our community is made of coders from around the globe with diverse skills,
backgrounds, and experiences. When you're reading or commenting on documentation or
code, interacting with other members of the community via email or other digital
communication, or attending events where members of our community are present,
this Code of Conduct will help inform your interactions and reinforce values that
contribute to a positive environment.

## Expected behavior

* Be welcoming. Use inclusive language.
* Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
* Be receptive to constructive comments and criticism.
* Show empathy towards other community members.
* Be respectful of others' positions, skills, commitments, and efforts.

## Inappropriate behavior

* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
* The use of sexualized language or imagery. Unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
* Language or imagery that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence, emotional, or physical harm against an individual or a group of people.
* Public or private harassment.
* Personal insults, especially those using racist, ableist, ageist, homophobic, or sexist terms.
* Defaming an individual or group, or violating any trademarks or copyrighted material.
* Publishing private or identifying information or non-harassing communication without explicit permission.
* Dismissing or attacking inclusion-oriented requests.
* Continual disruption of talks, workshops, or other events.
* Offensive comments related to race/ethnicity or national origin, sex or gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, mental illness or neurotypicality, body size, caste, age, or religion.
* Threats or acts of violence.
* Deliberate intimidation.
* Encouraging any of the above behavior.

## Reporting harassment

If you believe that someone is violating the code of conduct, or have any
other concerns, please contact Mark Chu-Carroll (current project leader)
immediately by sending an email to markcc@gmail.com.

All reports will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response
that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

If you feel threatened or violated as a result of intimidating, harassing,
abusive, discriminatory, derogatory, or demeaning conduct, please immediately
notify Mark Chu-Carroll at  `markcc@gmail.com` This applies to online and in-person interactions.

### Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

* Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

The Simplex project community has the right and responsibility to remove comments or
other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban
temporarily or permanently any members for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

If a participant engages in unacceptable behavior, Simplex project community members,
and any designated representatives may take any of the following actions, up to and
including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning.

These actions may include, but are not limited to:

* A warning to cease their behavior and that any further reports will result in further actions.
* Removal from any mailing lists.
* Revoking of access rights to the Simplex repository on github.
* Suspension or deletion of accounts related to the Simplex project.
* Reporting behavior to the applicable authorities.

These don't cover every possible naughty (or nice) act. We reserve the right
to reject or redact any comments or posts that violate the spirit, as well
as the letter, of our policies. And for good comments? Sometimes we have cookies.

Please remember to respect whatever rules your employer might have about
communities like this. We want you to participate as  much as possible,
but not because you got fired and suddenly have a lot of free time on your
hands. In fact, we'd prefer it if your employer got really excited about
the site and encouraged you to learn and share here. But if they want to
get involved by buying ad space, we're not selling. This site is a community.
Communities are about relationships. And we'd prefer not to have to change
our relationship status with anyone to "It's complicated."

That's all. Go forth and be open. If you find relevant, helpful ideas
here--share them with the world. That's what this site is about.
